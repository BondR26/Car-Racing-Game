Car racing game using sfml
For this games to work you gonna need to put the 4 csfml libs in the bin/debug folder of your project.
then you gonna need to add 3 sfml dlls (graphics, window and audio) to the references
Finally you will need your own 'Content' folder (you can find the path of mine in the class Content) and three folder 
start_to_finish - contains pictures (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, finish.png, win.png, lost.png)
